# Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure that you have the following:

Python installed: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
A Telegram account: You'll need this to create a bot.
A basic understanding of Python and APIs.
Steps to Build a Python Telegram To-Do Bot
1. Create a Telegram Bot
Open Telegram and search for the BotFather bot.
Type /newbot and follow the instructions to create a new bot.
Once youâ€™ve created the bot, BotFather will provide you with an API Token. Save this token, as we will need it later in our Python script.

2. Create Virtual enviornment using below command

        py -m venv venv

then activate vitual enviornment using

    venv/script/activate
3. Install the required libraries using pip:

You'll need the python-telegram-bot package to interact with the Telegram API.


pip install python-telegram-bot


Step-by-Step Plan:
Set up a Telegram Bot:

Use the Telegram BotFather to create a bot and obtain your API TOKEN.
Install required Python libraries.
Build out the project file structure.
Implement the Core Bot Features:

Add, view, delete, and list tasks.
Store the to-do tasks in a simple JSON or SQLite database.
Set up a Bot Command Structure:

Use commands like /start, /add, /list, /delete.
Ensure Clean Code Structure:

Separate concerns into different files (bot logic, database handling, etc.).
Use proper comments and docstrings for clarity.
